## Risk Alerts & Safety Monitoring – User Stories
Below user stories define the **minimum viable scope** that delivers real value to clinicians.

| ID | As a… | I want / So that | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| RA-01 | Practitioner | to see **low-mood alerts** on my dashboard so that I can quickly identify clients who may need urgent attention | • When a session note within the past 7 days has mood ≤ 3, an alert appears.<br>• Alert lists client name, date, and mood rating.<br>• If multiple low-mood notes exist for the same client, only the most recent is shown. |
| RA-02 | Practitioner | to **navigate** directly from an alert to the client profile for more context | • Clicking an alert opens `/clients/:id` in a new tab or route. |
| RA-03 | Practitioner | to have the dashboard show **"No alerts"** when none are present | • If API returns empty `alerts` array, an informational "No current risk alerts" message is displayed instead of the list. |
| RA-04 | Practitioner | the alerts list to update automatically after I enter a new session note | • Submitting a new note (with or without low mood) triggers a dashboard refresh (manual page reload acceptable for MVP). |
| RA-05 | Admin | to seed **demo alert data** for training & demo purposes | • Running `node server/scripts/full-demo-setup.js` creates at least one low-mood note that surfaces an alert. |

**Out-of-scope** (future work):
* Acknowledging / dismissing alerts
* Push notifications, email/SMS
* Escalation workflows & audit trail
* Configurable alert thresholds

These stories ensure a **clinically useful, end-to-end risk alert** capability while fitting within a focused 4-hour development window. 

## Advanced Analytics (Diagnosis-Based User Engagement) – User Stories
Provide clinicians with insights into client engagement segmented by diagnosis. Engagement is measured by session attendance, note completion, and mood check-ins.

|-------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| AA-01 | Practitioner  | to see a chart of client engagement by diagnosis      | • Dashboard shows a bar chart: diagnosis (x-axis), avg. engagement score (y-axis).<br>• Engagement score = weighted sum of attendance, notes, check-ins. |
| AA-02 | Practitioner  | to drill down to see which clients are least engaged  | • Clicking a bar lists clients with that diagnosis, sorted by engagement. |
| AA-03 | Admin         | to export engagement analytics for reporting          | • Button to download CSV of engagement by diagnosis and client. |
